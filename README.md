# TO DO

0. Restructure event code to be a method of the card or player.
1. Create the turn system. When one person clicks an attack, the next person goes.
2. On a card death, next player should be prompted to pick a new active card.
3. On a new card draw, another card should be pulled form the player's DECK to fill the empty bench if possible.
4. Possibly restructure the data-html things since they may become difficult to update later on with the addition of attack boosts and drops/status effects etc.
5. Add in the accuracy trait to attacks. Make it possible to miss if the accuracy dictates so.
